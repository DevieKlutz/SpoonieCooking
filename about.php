	<h2> About Us</h2>
		<p> We are a queer disabled couple. My name is Hanna and my partner's name is Ana. Together we decided to create a website focused on helping other disabled people cook!</p>
		<br>
		<p>Ana and I have been together for more than 6 years now and one of the things we love to do together is cook! But we both have restrictions on our diets due to allergies and chronic illness, so we've had to come up with a lot of workarounds over the years. We have decided to share our knowledge, as well as collect similar workarounds from disabled friends, so that others can benefit and enjoy good food.</p>
		<br>
		<p> We will try to cover as many ingredient substitutions and cooking hacks as we can for each recipe but I am sure that we will miss things here and there, if you find that there is something missing, have questions about a specific ingredient or method, have advice of your own, or would like to request help with making a recipe accessible to you please feel free to fill out the contact form and we will do our best to help!</p>

	<h2>About The Site</h2>
		<p> This is a site dedicated to making cooking and the kitchen in general as accessible as possible. You may be wondering why we called ourselves Spoonie Cooking, well the answer is that we are referencing <a href="https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/">The Spoon Theory</a> which is a shorthand that many disabled people use to express their energy and strength and stamina in regards to their disability and daily tasks.</p> <br>
		<p> One of the resources that we use for hacks, recipes and gadgets, or at least the ideas that get us to where we are in any of the hacks or recipes we will be posting is a Youtube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAzyupPG4vdo8jd9nJ13LAw">Barry Lewis</a> named after the channel's creator. The following video is an example of Barry's very long playlist of kitchen gadget testing videos, many of the gadgets he tests can be very useful for disabled people!</p>
